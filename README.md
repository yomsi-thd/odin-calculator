# Calculator Web Application

The calculator app is going to contain functions for all of the basic maths operators that's typically found on calculators
- Add `+`
- Subtract `-`
- Multiply `x`
- Divide `/`

A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number.
The calculator will store the 1st and 2nd number input by the user and then operate on them 
when the user press the `=` button

The calculator will only do 1 operation at a time. 
If the user clicks on an operator before the previous operation is calculated, 
the operation is then calculated automatically and turned into a sum. 
Then, the sum is used for the calculation for the next operation.

Whenever, the user wants to clear all of previous calculation, they can do the following
- Press on the "Clear" button
- Press on another number after the previous operation is completed.
